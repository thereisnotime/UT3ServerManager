After server login, you can use ~ for entering commands:

AdminLogin – Logs you in as an admin
AdminLogout – Logs you out of admin mode
AdminRestartMap – Restarts the current map
AdminChangeMap – Loads a different map (gametype will change too, depending on map)
Admin addbots <#> – Adds number of bots
Admin killbots – Removes all bots
AdminPlayerList – Shows PlayerID of players
Adminkick – Kicks player from current game
Adminkickban – Kicks player from current game and bans player from reconnecting
AdminForceVoiceMute – Blocks a player from sending voip to others
AdminForceVoiceUnMute – Allows a player to resume sending voip to others
AdminForceTextMute – Blocks a player from sending text to others
AdminForceTextUnMute – Allows a player to resume sending text to others
AdminPublishMapList – Overrides the server’s map list for the current game type with the one on the client that used the command

Removing a restriction on a banned player can be done by modifying the utgame.ini file for the server. This is stored by default in the following location:
C:\Documents and Settings\<Windows User Name>\My Documents\My Games\Unreal Tournament 3 Demo\UTGame\Config.

Note that the goal and time limits will persist from the arguments used in the commandline when starting the server. This can lead to problems where a reasonable VCTF score limit of 3 will translate to a frag limit of 3 when when switching gametypes this way. Leaving those limits blank when starting the server will however use the defaults for the gametype. This allows some flexibility in switching gametypes using this command.
